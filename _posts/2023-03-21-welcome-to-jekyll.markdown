## Introduction

Criminal behaviour has been an ongoing research field to assist in crime prevention. One way to better understand criminal behaviour is investigating the correlation between different crimes. Analysing correlation between different crimes can provide insights for criminal behavior in specific areas. We can also gain information on the motivations and methods of criminals, and use this information to develop more effective strategies for preventing and responding to crime. Some potentially correlated crimes are drugs and robbery. If there is a strong correlation between drug use and robbery in a given area, solving drug problems in the area may effectively reduce robbery crimes in the area as well. We will be analysing a dataset retrieved from DataSF (https://datasf.org/opendata/), which consists of crime data in San Franscisco from 2003 to 2018. We will be investigating the following crime types: ['DRUG/NARCOTIC', 'ROBBERY', 'BURGLARY', 'LARCENY/THEFT'].

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
